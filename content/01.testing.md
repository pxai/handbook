# Testing {#testing}

Unit testing is much more than a tool for ensuring that a program behaves as expected. Nowadays it's the key for new development techniques such as TDD and BDD in which you begin writing tests before the required code. It's all about requirements and behaviour; developers must focus on understanding the requirements instead of thinking about the way they implement the code. In the event that you've forgotten the fundamental benefits of unit testing here you have a quick reminder:

*   Obviously, you are testing that your code works
*   When changes are made you can automatically verify that everything works
*   Tests are a pretty good way to document the project.
