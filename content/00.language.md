When it comes to language preferences, it's always the same. Some people don't like java at all. Many coders think that php is not a language to be taken seriously. Other radicals hate whatever.NET from Microsoft. There are always fierce Python and Ruby supporters. I think that you have to forget your preferences and try to learn them all and master a few of them. Which language is the best? it depends. After all, web servers are written in c++ (yeah, nodejs too) and that's fine. And on top of the webserver we have realms of webapps built with interpreted languages: php, python, ruby, java, c#, js, ... . As for the dbms: frequently coded in c++, with sql, js, json on top.
